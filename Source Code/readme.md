### This code is a sample implementation for detecting autism-related behaviors using a limited dataset and restricted output cells. It includes three sample behaviors and demonstrates behavior prediction and data export processes. Due to the sensitivity of the actual data, this project uses a simplified version for open-source review purposes while aiming to showcase the core functionalities.
